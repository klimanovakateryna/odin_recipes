        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 cups diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta</li>
            <li>1 pound peeled and deveined medium shrimp</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic; cook 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, and wine. Bring to a simmer and cook 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Once the tomatoes have simmered into a sauce, stir in the butter and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly-salted water; bring to a rolling boil; stir in the linguine and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Season the shrimp with the Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the shrimp and cook until pink on the outside and no longer translucent in the center, about 5 minutes. Stir the shrimp into the pasta sauce, then stir the sauce into the linguine to serve.</li>
        </ol>
